make sure you have miniconda
https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main

(ADD INSTRUCTIONS ON MINICONDA SETUP HERE)

we are using py 3.10

if ur on mac/linux, make sure to use setup-bash
rather than setup-bat

run the following commands:
```shell
chmod +x ./setup-bash
source ./setup-bash
```

```shell
chmod +x ./setup-bat
source ./setup-bash
```
then run source ./setup-bash

thjen somewhere here, make sure to add kind of like instructions on pushing to the repo -- jut make sure to run the bash one more time so tht we compile the latest requriements



(can someone make this readme better thanks LOL)
