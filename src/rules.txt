### This is just a reference document. Its (current) purpose is simply to document the different
### rules that we are thinking of implementing during the rule-based phase (or if applicable, in
### some other phase) -- feel free to repurpose in the future!

### It will likely help our case if we are able to provide a justification document for why we
### chose to implement these rules in specific. Does not have to be a whole new separate doc,
### instead if we choose to make a slide deck we can incorporate it there.
